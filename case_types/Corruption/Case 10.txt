This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the undue advantages gained through corrupt practices; (ii) to cease the illegal tendering process; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, a business owner who participated in a government tender for road construction, discovered that the successful bidder was favored due to bribery. Senior government officials manipulated the tendering process, deliberately excluding legitimate competitors and awarding the contract to a company owned by a relative of the senior official. This led to financial losses for the complainant, who invested time and resources into the bidding process under the assumption of fairness.

The complainant learned that a politician, a government officer, and the contractor involved in the bid were all complicit in the corrupt arrangement.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Parties' actions should be penalized, and the complainant should be compensated for the unfair exclusion.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Parties (Shri Arvind Patel, Mr. Sanjay Mehra, and Mr. Rajesh Kumar) are directed –

(i) To pay ₹5 crore in damages to the complainant for the loss caused due to the biased tendering process.

(ii) To cease all corrupt practices in the government tendering system and implement transparent bidding protocols.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 45 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 10% per annum until full realization.
