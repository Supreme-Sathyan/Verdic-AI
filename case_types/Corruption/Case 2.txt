This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the unfair rejection in the police recruitment process; (ii) to investigate the corruption involving bribes for recruitment; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, a young individual who passed all eligibility tests for the police recruitment exam, was unfairly rejected from the selection process. After further inquiry, the complainant discovered that several candidates, including influential individuals with personal connections to police officers, were selected despite failing the physical and written exams. The complainant learned that these individuals had bribed senior officers to secure their positions.

As the twist unfolds, the complainant is approached by an anonymous whistleblower within the police force, who claims to have been part of the corrupt recruitment process. The whistleblower offers key evidence, including a list of bribe amounts and names of those involved in the conspiracy. The whistleblower requests that the complainant come forward and expose the entire network of corruption, fearing retaliation if they do so alone.

The complainant, now with this newfound information, decides to take action not only for personal justice but to bring down the entire system of corruption, potentially implicating the police department's leadership.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Parties' corrupt actions should be penalized, and the complainant should be compensated for the rejection and the emotional distress caused by the scandal.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Parties (Shri Vinod Sharma, Ms. Nisha Kapoor, and Shri Rakesh Gupta) are directed –

(i) To pay ₹10 lakh in compensation to the complainant for the rejection of the application due to corruption.

(ii) To cease all unfair recruitment practices and ensure a transparent, merit-based selection process.

(iii) To conduct a thorough investigation into the recruitment process, ensuring all candidates who were unfairly rejected due to corruption are given a fair chance to reapply.

(iv) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 12% per annum until full realization.
