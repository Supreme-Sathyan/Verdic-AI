This complaint is filed by the complainant U/Sec. 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the damage caused to their vehicle; (ii) to ensure that the vehicle is repaired or provide an equivalent replacement; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant parked their vehicle outside a residential area when the Opposite Party’s minor child, unsupervised, vandalized the vehicle by scratching it and causing dent damage. Despite several requests to the Opposite Party for compensation, the matter remained unresolved.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Party should be held accountable for the actions of their child and compensate the complainant accordingly.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed and the Opposite Party is directed –

(i) To pay Rs. 20,000 for repairs to the complainant’s vehicle.

(ii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 30 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 6% per annum until full realization.
