This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the defective medical equipment provided; (ii) to cease the illegal procurement process; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, a hospital administrator, procured a batch of medical equipment through the government’s procurement program. The equipment, which was advertised as state-of-the-art, turned out to be outdated and defective. Investigations revealed that the supplier had bribed a senior government official to win the contract and provide substandard equipment at inflated prices.

The complainant’s hospital incurred significant losses and faced medical malpractice risks due to the defective equipment.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Parties' corrupt practices must be penalized, and the complainant should be compensated for the financial loss and safety concerns caused by the defective equipment.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Parties (Mr. Harish Patil, Mr. Sunil Joshi, and Mr. Ramesh Kumar) are directed –

(i) To refund the ₹3 crore spent on defective equipment purchased through the corrupt procurement process.

(ii) To cease any fraudulent procurement practices and ensure that future contracts are awarded based on quality and merit.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 12% per annum until full realization.
