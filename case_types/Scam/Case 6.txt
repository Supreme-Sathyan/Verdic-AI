This complaint is filed by the complainants U/Sec. 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to immediately cease and desist from operating fraudulent stock manipulation schemes; (ii) to refund all money deposited by investors who were misled into purchasing worthless shares; (iii) to compensate the aggrieved investors for their financial losses amounting to Rs. 20,00,000; (iv) to award exemplary damages of Rs. 10,00,000 for defrauding the public through stock market manipulation; (v) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in Example v. Stock Manipulators Ltd. in Civil Appeal No. 2456 of 2024 CPJ 47 (SC) confirmed the orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, holding that misleading investors and inflating stock prices through false representations constitutes fraud and consumer exploitation. Respectfully following the ratio of the aforesaid judgments of the Hon’ble Court (supra), we held that the Opposite Party, by manipulating stock prices, is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation and exploitation of investors.

In the present case, the Opposite Party, "Tech Titan" Inc., launched a startup with a media frenzy, creating a hype around its potential success. Investors rushed to buy shares based on promises of revolutionary technology and profitability. However, the company’s technology was flawed and its business model unsustainable. The entrepreneur and his associates cashed out at the peak, leaving investors holding worthless stock.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that directing the Opposite Party to refund the defrauded amounts, compensate investors, and impose exemplary damages would meet the ends of justice. Furthermore, we are inclined to direct the Opposite Party to immediately cease all fraudulent stock manipulation activities and cooperate fully with regulatory authorities in the recovery of funds.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed and the Opposite Party is directed –

(i) To immediately cease and desist from operating fraudulent stock market schemes and manipulation of share prices.

(ii) To refund all money deposited by investors, which was misappropriated under false pretenses, under the supervision of this Commission, within 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders.

(iii) To pay compensation of Rs. 20,00,000 to the affected investors for their financial losses.

(iv) To pay exemplary damages of Rs. 10,00,000 for deliberately misleading and defrauding consumers through fraudulent business practices.

(v) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainants in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 90 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 9% per annum until full realization.
