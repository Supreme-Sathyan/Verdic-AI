This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the loss of life; (ii) to ensure justice is served for the murder; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, Mr. Rajesh Yadav, reported the murder of his younger brother, Ramesh Yadav, on 12th January 2023. Ramesh was found dead at his workplace, a construction site in Greater Noida. Initial investigations revealed that Ramesh had been strangled with a piece of cloth, and the murderer had left no trace of DNA.

The police identified the prime suspect, Mr. Sunil Sharma, who was a disgruntled coworker of the victim. During the investigation, it was revealed that Mr. Sharma had been involved in a dispute with Ramesh over a payment and had previously made threats against him.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that Mr. Sharma should be penalized for the murder of Ramesh Yadav, and the complainant should receive compensation for the loss of his family member.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Party (Mr. Sunil Sharma) is directed –

(i) To be arrested and charged with murder.

(ii) To pay ₹5,00,000 as compensation to the family of the victim.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant.

Time for compliance is 30 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 12% per annum until full realization.
