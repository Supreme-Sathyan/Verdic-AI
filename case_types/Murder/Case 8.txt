This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to ensure a fair investigation into the death; (ii) to provide compensation to the grieving parents; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, Mr. and Mrs. Prakash, reported the tragic murder of their daughter, Ms. Aarti Prakash, a second-year college student, found dead in her dormitory on 22nd May 2023. Early investigations suggest she was murdered by a fellow student, Mr. Ravi Sharma, due to a personal vendetta.

Despite evidence pointing to Mr. Sharma, the investigation was hindered due to his family’s political influence, which delayed the arrest.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that justice should be served, and the complainant’s family deserves compensation for the loss of their daughter.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Party (Mr. Ravi Sharma) is directed –

(i) To pay ₹5,00,000 as compensation to the complainant.

(ii) To ensure that the investigation is completed without delay and that justice is served.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant.

Time for compliance is 30 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 10% per annum until full realization.
