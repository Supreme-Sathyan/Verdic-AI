This complaint is filed by the complainant U/Sec. 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to cease the sale of illegal drugs; (ii) to compensate the complainant for the loss of health due to consumption of the drugs purchased from the Opposite Party; (iii) to pay for the medical treatment expenses amounting to Rs. 30,000; (iv) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, seeking relief from insomnia, unknowingly purchased a drug from the Opposite Party's shop that was later found to be illegal and harmful to health. The complainant experienced serious side effects after taking the medication, leading to hospitalization and further medical treatment.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Party’s illegal actions in selling prohibited substances must be penalized, and compensation for the medical expenses should be awarded.

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed and the Opposite Party is directed –

(i) To immediately cease and desist from selling illegal drugs or harmful substances.

(ii) To pay compensation of Rs. 30,000 to the complainant for medical expenses incurred due to the consumption of the harmful drug.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 9% per annum until full realization.
