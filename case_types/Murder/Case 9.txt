This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to provide support for the family of the deceased; (ii) to ensure the fair investigation of the murder; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, Mr. Aman Gupta, filed a case regarding the murder of his wife, Ms. Rina Gupta, an investigative journalist. On 3rd April 2023, Ms. Gupta was found dead in her apartment with signs of blunt force trauma. The police investigation suggests that her reporting on corrupt government officials might have played a role in her untimely death.

The police have named multiple suspects, including political figures and a corrupt businessman, but the investigation has slowed down due to political pressure.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that immediate action should be taken to ensure that the murder investigation is pursued without interference.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Party (Police Authorities and Political Figures) are directed –

(i) To continue the investigation without interference from political or business entities.

(ii) To ensure the safety and security of the complainant’s family.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant.

Time for compliance is 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 8% per annum until full realization.
