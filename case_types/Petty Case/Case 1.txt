This complaint is filed by the complainant U/Sec. 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for misleading advertisements; (ii) to cease the use of deceptive marketing strategies; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant was lured by a promotional offer from the Opposite Party for a free trial of a health supplement. However, after using the product, the complainant discovered that the "free trial" was a deceptive marketing tactic that led to recurring charges. The product had no health benefits and caused adverse effects.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Party’s deceptive advertising should be penalized, and the complainant should be compensated for the undue charges and health complications.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed and the Opposite Party is directed –

(i) To refund the Rs. 10,000 wrongly charged to the complainant for the health supplement.

(ii) To cease the deceptive advertising and pay a penalty for misleading marketing.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 45 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 9% per annum until full realization.
