This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the financial and emotional damage caused; (ii) to cease any further involvement in corrupt practices; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant was a student admitted to a reputed university after paying a hefty donation for a seat in a government-aided course. After enrolling, the complainant discovered that the donation was part of a corrupt system where university officials, including a government officer and a politician, accepted bribes in exchange for admissions into various programs.

The complainant learned that several other students were also misled, paying exorbitant sums for admissions in exchange for minimal academic standards.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Parties' corrupt actions must be penalized, and the complainant should be compensated for the loss of their rightful education.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Parties (Shri Manish Kumar, Mr. Rajiv Sharma, and Mr. Amit Desai) are directed –

(i) To refund the ₹2 lakh illegally charged as donation for admission to the complainant.

(ii) To cease the corrupt admission process and implement a transparent, merit-based admission procedure.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 12% per annum until full realization.
