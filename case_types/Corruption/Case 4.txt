This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the misallocation of housing; (ii) to cease the corrupt practices within the housing scheme; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant applied for a government-subsidized housing scheme meant for low-income individuals. After fulfilling all the required conditions and paying a registration fee, the complainant was informed that they had been allocated a home. However, further investigation revealed that the housing unit had already been illegally occupied by a wealthy individual who bribed the officials overseeing the allocation process.

The complainant, having been denied the housing they were promised, suffered financial hardship and emotional distress.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Parties' corrupt actions must be penalized, and the complainant should be compensated for the loss of housing.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Parties (Shri Arun Kapoor, Ms. Priya Mehta, and Mr. Mahesh Kumar) are directed –

(i) To pay ₹15 lakh as compensation for the misallocation of the housing unit.

(ii) To cease corrupt practices within the housing allocation scheme and ensure that housing is distributed according to merit and need.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 45 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 12% per annum until full realization.
