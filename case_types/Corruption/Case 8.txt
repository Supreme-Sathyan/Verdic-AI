This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the fraudulent denial of claims; (ii) to cease the corrupt practices of the insurance company; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant purchased a health insurance policy from the Opposite Party, which included comprehensive coverage for medical treatments. However, when the complainant needed surgery, the insurance company, under the influence of a corrupt official, unjustly denied the claim, citing false reasons. Investigation revealed that the official had been accepting bribes to approve or reject claims at their discretion.

The complainant was left with significant medical expenses and a refusal of rightful compensation.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Party’s actions should be penalized, and the complainant should be compensated for the unjust denial.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Parties (Mr. Prakash Verma, Ms. Pooja Singh, and Mr. Sandeep Agarwal) are directed –

(i) To pay ₹4 lakh in compensation to the complainant for the unjust denial of the medical claim.

(ii) To cease all corrupt practices within the claims department and ensure transparency in the claim process.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 45 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 10% per annum until full realization.
