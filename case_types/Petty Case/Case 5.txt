This complaint is filed by the complainant U/Sec. 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the stolen jewelry; (ii) to return the stolen property or pay the equivalent value; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, upon returning home, discovered that jewelry worth Rs. 50,000 had been stolen from their house. It was later revealed that the Opposite Party, a known acquaintance of the family, had gained access to the house under false pretenses and stolen the valuables while the family was away.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Party is liable for the theft and should compensate the complainant for the stolen property.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed and the Opposite Party is directed –

(i) To pay Rs. 50,000 as compensation for the stolen jewelry or return the stolen items in their original condition within 30 days.

(ii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 8% per annum until full realization.
