This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the incomplete roadwork and financial loss; (ii) to cease all corrupt practices in the allocation of public contracts; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, a local resident, witnessed the construction of a road funded by public money. The project was awarded to a contractor who had a history of corruption. Despite receiving full payment, the contractor did not complete the work as per the contract specifications. The complainant uncovered that the contractor had bribed the public works officer to ensure that the work was done poorly, with substandard materials used and several sections left unfinished.

The complainant's neighborhood faced traffic disruptions and safety hazards due to the incomplete work.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Parties' corrupt practices should be penalized, and the complainant should be compensated for the financial loss caused by the incomplete public works.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Parties (Mr. Pradeep Singh, Mr. Karan Kumar, and Mr. Suresh Yadav) are directed –

(i) To pay ₹2 crore in damages for the incomplete roadwork and the financial loss caused to the community.

(ii) To cease all corrupt practices within the public works contracting system and ensure that future projects are completed with quality and integrity.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 10% per annum until full realization.
