This complaint is filed by the complainant U/Sec. 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to immediately cease and desist from deducting undisclosed commissions from donation funds before transferring them to beneficiaries; (ii) to refund the misappropriated commission amounts to the donors or intended recipients; (iii) to compensate the affected donors for the financial losses amounting to Rs.12,75,000/- (Rupees Twelve Lakhs Seventy-Five Thousand only); (iv) to award exemplary damages of Rs.3,50,000/- (Rupees Three Lakhs Fifty Thousand only) for misleading the public under the guise of charity; (v) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in Example v. Charity Fraud Ltd. in Civil Appeal No. 1987 of 2024 CPJ 39 (SC) confirmed the orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, holding that online donation platforms must ensure full transparency regarding fund utilization and any commission deductions. Respectfully following the ratio of the aforesaid judgments of the Hon’ble Court (supra), we held that the Opposite Party, by engaging in undisclosed deductions of donation funds, is guilty of financial misconduct and consumer deception.

In the present case, the Opposite Party, CharityLink Foundation, an online crowdfunding platform, claimed to transfer 100% of donations to individuals in need. However, investigations revealed that the platform secretly deducted 30% of every donation as a hidden commission before disbursing the remaining amount to intended beneficiaries. This commission was not disclosed to the donors, who were led to believe that their full contributions were reaching the needy. Many donors, upon discovering this hidden practice, felt deceived and misled, leading to widespread complaints. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the platform inflated transaction processing fees to disguise additional deductions, further increasing its illicit earnings.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that directing the Opposite Party to refund the misappropriated funds, compensate the donors, and impose exemplary damages would meet the ends of justice. Furthermore, we are inclined to direct the Opposite Party to immediately implement a full disclosure policy regarding donation deductions and cooperate with regulatory authorities for further scrutiny.

Point No.2:
In the result, the complaint is partly allowed and the Opposite Party is directed –

(i) To immediately cease and desist from making undisclosed deductions from donation funds and ensure full transparency regarding all commissions and fees.

(ii) To refund the deducted commissions from past donations to either the original donors or the intended recipients, under the supervision of this Commission, within 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders.

(iii) To pay compensation of Rs.12,75,000/- (Rupees Twelve Lakhs Seventy-Five Thousand only) to the affected donors for financial losses incurred due to misleading donation practices.

(iv) To pay exemplary damages of Rs.3,50,000/- (Rupees Three Lakhs Fifty Thousand only) for misusing public trust and misleading contributors under the guise of charity.

(v) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 90 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 9% per annum until full realization.
