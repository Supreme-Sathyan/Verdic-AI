This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the environmental damages caused by their corrupt practices; (ii) to investigate the unlawful allocation of funds; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, a local environmental activist, discovered a large-scale corruption scandal involving the allocation of funds meant for an environmental protection project in their city. A government department had been allocated millions to restore a forest and clean the river nearby, but the funds were being diverted into the pockets of contractors and officials who colluded to embezzle the money.

The twist comes when the complainant discovers that a well-known environmental NGO, which had been publicly advocating for the project, is secretly involved in the scheme, receiving kickbacks in exchange for covering up the corruption. The NGO’s representatives had been presenting fake progress reports to the government while the money was siphoned off.

Further complicating the case, the complainant is informed that some of the contractors involved have connections with powerful corporate entities seeking to build real estate developments on the land that was supposed to be protected. These entities, it turns out, have been bribing both the government officials and the NGO to facilitate their construction plans under the guise of “development.”

As the complainant delves deeper into this tangled web, they begin to receive threats warning them to stop their investigation. Despite the danger, the complainant chooses to bring the truth to light, risking their life to expose both the government’s corruption and the corporate entities seeking to profit at the environment’s expense.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Parties’ corrupt actions should be penalized, and the complainant should be compensated for the environmental harm caused by the scandal.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Parties (Shri Amit Khanna, Ms. Priyanka Reddy, and the Board Members of GreenFuture NGO) are directed –

(i) To pay ₹20 crore in damages to the local community for the environmental harm caused by the illegal diversion of funds.

(ii) To cease all illicit real estate developments on the protected forest land and restore the funds to the project to ensure proper environmental conservation.

(iii) To undergo a full audit of all environmental protection funds received by the government and private entities in the last five years.

(iv) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 90 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 15% per annum until full realization.
