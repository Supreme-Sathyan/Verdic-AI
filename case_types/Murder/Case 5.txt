This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to ensure justice for the victim; (ii) to assist in the investigation and provide evidence; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, Mr. Vishal Singh, lost his wife, Ms. Meera Singh, who was murdered during a real estate transaction on 20th September 2023. Ms. Singh had been negotiating a land deal with a local builder, Mr. Arvind Reddy, when she was shot dead in her office. Police suspect that the motive behind the murder was a dispute over the land deal.

Despite multiple leads, Mr. Reddy has evaded arrest, and key evidence has been tampered with.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the case requires immediate action and the complainant should be compensated for the loss.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant.

Time for compliance is 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 9% per annum until full realization.
