This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to investigate the murder of an environmental activist; (ii) to ensure justice for the family; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, Ms. Asha Patel, reported the murder of her sister, Ms. Neelam Patel, a renowned environmental activist, found dead in a remote forest area on 12th December 2023. Her murder appears to be connected to her work in opposing illegal deforestation by a logging company led by Mr. Anil Rao.

The investigation has been delayed due to possible influence from the logging company’s owners.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that further steps should be taken to ensure a fair and prompt investigation.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Party (Mr. Anil Rao and the Logging Company) are directed –

(i) To cooperate fully with the investigation.

(ii) To pay ₹12,00,000 as compensation to the complainant.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant.

Time for compliance is 45 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 10% per annum until full realization.
