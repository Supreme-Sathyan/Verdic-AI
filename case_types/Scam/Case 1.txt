This complaint is filed by the complainant U/Sec.12 of Consumer Protection Act, 1986 praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to immediately cease and desist from promoting unregulated online gambling platforms and disseminating misleading “winning tips” through his social media channels; (ii) to refund all sums collected through such deceptive promotions and affiliate deals to his defrauded followers; (iii) to compensate the aggrieved victims for the financial losses incurred, amounting to Rs.25,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty-Five Lakhs only); (iv) to pay Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakhs only) towards exemplary damages for the emotional and financial trauma caused; (v) to award costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in Example v. Digital Influencers Ltd. in Civil Appeal No. 2058 of 2024 CPJ 35 (SC) confirmed the orders of the Appellate Tribunal wherein the said Tribunal held that any individual who, by the use of influential media channels, induces the public to engage in financially hazardous activities through false promises and fabricated success stories is liable for the resulting consumer detriment. Respectfully following the ratio of the aforesaid judgments of the Hon’ble Tribunal and Hon’ble Supreme Court (supra), we held that the Opposite Party, by exploiting his social media influence to promote online gambling through exaggerated claims and orchestrated “lucky streaks,” is liable for engaging in unfair trade practices. In the present case, Jaganathan, popularly known as "Jackpot Jaga," built a massive following in Tamil Nadu by showcasing a lavish lifestyle complete with luxury cars, designer clothes, and exotic vacations, all underpinned by his aggressive endorsement of online gambling platforms. By offering “exclusive tips” and fabricated winning formulas, and by creating a false sense of urgency and community among his predominantly young and vulnerable audience, he deceived over 250 followers into investing their savings and incurring heavy debts. Hence, keeping in view the above said facts, we are of the considered opinion that directing the Opposite Party to refund the ill-gotten gains, compensate the victims, and pay exemplary damages would meet the ends of justice.

Point No.2: In the result, the complaint is partly allowed and the Opposite Party is directed –
(i) To immediately cease and desist from any further promotion of online gambling platforms through misleading content and deceptive practices.

(ii) To refund all amounts received from his followers through affiliate deals and deceptive endorsements, under the supervision of this Commission, within 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders.

(iii) To pay compensation of Rs.25,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty-Five Lakhs only) to the aggrieved victims for the financial losses incurred due to his deceptive practices.

(iv) To pay exemplary damages of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakhs only) for the emotional and financial trauma inflicted on his followers.

(v) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting these proceedings.

Time for compliance is 90 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall carry interest at the rate of 9% per annum until full realization.
