This complaint is filed by the complainant U/Sec. 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to pay compensation to the complainant for the loss of the gold chain snatched by the accused; (ii) to reimburse the complainant for the emotional distress caused by the incident; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant was walking down a busy street when the Opposite Party, riding a motorcycle, snatched her gold chain and fled the scene. Despite efforts to report the incident to the local police, the Opposite Party was not apprehended, leaving the complainant without her valuable possession and emotionally disturbed by the attack.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Party should be held accountable for the loss of the complainant’s chain and emotional distress caused.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed and the Opposite Party is directed –

(i) To pay compensation of Rs. 15,000 to the complainant for the loss of the gold chain and emotional distress caused by the snatching.

(ii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 45 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 7% per annum until full realization.
