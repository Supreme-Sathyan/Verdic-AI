This complaint is filed by the complainants U/Sec. 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to immediately cease and desist from operating fraudulent travel agency schemes; (ii) to refund all money deposited by consumers who were misled into believing they had purchased legitimate vacation packages; (iii) to compensate the aggrieved users for their financial losses amounting to Rs. 8,00,000; (iv) to award exemplary damages of Rs. 4,00,000 for defrauding the public with misleading vacation offers; (v) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in Example v. Timeshare Scams Ltd. in Civil Appeal No. 2456 of 2024 CPJ 47 (SC) confirmed the orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, holding that operating fraudulent vacation schemes under the guise of timeshare packages constitutes consumer deception and financial misconduct. Respectfully following the ratio of the aforesaid judgments of the Hon’ble Court (supra), we held that the Opposite Party, by selling worthless vacation packages, is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation.

In the present case, the Opposite Party, "Vacay Ventures" Pvt. Ltd., promised luxurious vacations through timeshare packages or discounted travel offers. However, when the complainants tried to book their vacation, they found that the timeshare was worthless or the travel agency had disappeared with their funds. Despite the promises of guaranteed bookings and perks, no such services were ever provided.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that directing the Opposite Party to refund the defrauded amounts, compensate users, and impose exemplary damages would meet the ends of justice. Furthermore, we are inclined to direct the Opposite Party to immediately halt all fraudulent promotional activities and cooperate fully with regulatory authorities in the recovery of funds.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed and the Opposite Party is directed –

(i) To immediately cease and desist from operating any fraudulent travel schemes disguised as legitimate vacation packages.

(ii) To refund all money deposited by users, which was misappropriated under false pretenses, under the supervision of this Commission, within 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders.

(iii) To pay compensation of Rs. 8,00,000 to the affected users for their financial losses.

(iv) To pay exemplary damages of Rs. 4,00,000 for deliberately misleading and defrauding consumers through a fraudulent business model.

(v) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainants in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 90 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 9% per annum until full realization.
