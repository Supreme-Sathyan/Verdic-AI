This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the loss of life; (ii) to ensure justice is served for the murder; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, Mr. Deepak Sharma, reported the brutal murder of his wife, Meera Sharma, on 23rd February 2023. Meera was found dead in their home with multiple stab wounds. There were no signs of forced entry into the house, suggesting the perpetrator was someone known to the victim.

The investigation revealed that the prime suspect was Mr. Rajan Kumar, Meera’s ex-boyfriend, who had been stalking her for months. After multiple failed attempts to reconcile, Mr. Kumar confronted Meera at her home and, in a fit of rage, stabbed her to death.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that Mr. Kumar should be penalized for the murder of Meera Sharma, and the complainant should receive compensation for the tragic loss.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Party (Mr. Rajan Kumar) is directed –

(i) To be arrested and charged with murder.

(ii) To pay ₹7,00,000 as compensation to the family of the victim.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant.

Time for compliance is 45 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 10% per annum until full realization.
