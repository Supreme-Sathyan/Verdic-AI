This complaint is filed by the complainants U/Sec. 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to immediately cease and desist from selling forged antiquities; (ii) to refund all money deposited by the complainants who were misled into purchasing a fake artifact; (iii) to compensate the complainants for their financial losses amounting to Rs. 15,00,000; (iv) to award exemplary damages of Rs. 7,00,000 for selling counterfeit items and deceiving consumers; (v) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in Example v. Art Forgers Ltd. in Civil Appeal No. 2456 of 2024 CPJ 47 (SC) confirmed the orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, holding that selling counterfeit antiquities as genuine pieces constitutes fraudulent misrepresentation. Respectfully following the ratio of the aforesaid judgments of the Hon’ble Court (supra), we held that the Opposite Party, by selling fake antiquities, is guilty of fraud and consumer deception.

In the present case, the Opposite Party, "Antique World" Pvt. Ltd., sold a purported rare artifact to the complainant at an inflated price, claiming it was a genuine relic from ancient civilization. However, upon expert analysis, it was discovered that the artifact was a clever forgery. Despite having full knowledge of the forgery, the Opposite Party continued to mislead the complainants about its authenticity.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that directing the Opposite Party to refund the defrauded amounts, compensate users, and impose exemplary damages would meet the ends of justice. Furthermore, we are inclined to direct the Opposite Party to immediately halt all fraudulent sales and cooperate fully with regulatory authorities in the recovery of funds.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed and the Opposite Party is directed –

(i) To immediately cease and desist from selling any forged antiquities as genuine items.

(ii) To refund all money deposited by the complainants, which was misappropriated under false pretenses, under the supervision of this Commission, within 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders.

(iii) To pay compensation of Rs. 15,00,000 to the affected users for their financial losses.

(iv) To pay exemplary damages of Rs. 7,00,000 for deliberately misleading and defrauding consumers through a fraudulent business model.

(v) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainants in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 90 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 9% per annum until full realization.
