This complaint is filed by the complainant U/Sec. 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the loss of personal belongings stolen from his pocket; (ii) to ensure that the individual who committed the theft is held accountable for his actions; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

In the present case, the complainant was traveling in a crowded bus when the Opposite Party, who was seated nearby, stealthily stole the complainant’s wallet containing cash and credit cards. Despite efforts to report the incident to the authorities, the thief was not apprehended, causing the complainant both financial and emotional distress.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Party’s actions amount to theft, and therefore, compensation should be awarded to the complainant for their losses.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed and the Opposite Party is directed –

(i) To pay compensation of Rs. 5,000 to the complainant for the loss of personal belongings and distress caused.

(ii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 30 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 6% per annum until full realization.
