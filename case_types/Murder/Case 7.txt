This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to investigate the case thoroughly; (ii) to provide compensation to the family of the deceased; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, Mr. Arun Sharma, lost his entire family in a gruesome murder that took place on 14th July 2023. His wife, children, and parents were found brutally murdered in their home. Evidence points to a hired assassin, Mr. Deepak Singh, who was allegedly hired by a distant relative for inheritance disputes.

The investigation has been slow, and key suspects have been released without charge, leading to suspicion of corruption within the police department.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Party’s negligence should be penalized, and the complainant should be compensated for the loss of his family.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Party (Police and Mr. Deepak Singh) is directed –

(i) To ensure the immediate arrest of the hired assassin, Mr. Deepak Singh.

(ii) To compensate the complainant with ₹15,00,000 for the loss of his family.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant.

Time for compliance is 90 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 11% per annum until full realization.
