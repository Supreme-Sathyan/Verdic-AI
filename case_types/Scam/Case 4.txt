This complaint is filed by the complainant U/Sec. 12 of the Securities Regulation Act, 1992 praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to immediately cease and desist from promoting unregulated and deceptive online gambling applications; (ii) to refund all commissions and profits earned through misleading endorsements; (iii) to compensate the aggrieved users for their financial losses amounting to Rs.15,00,000/- (Rupees Fifteen Lakhs only); (iv) to award exemplary damages of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakhs only) for misleading consumers and encouraging financial risks without disclosure; (v) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in Example v. Online Betting Syndicate in Civil Appeal No. 1456 of 2024 CPJ 45 (SC) confirmed the orders of the Consumer Redressal Forum wherein it was held that influencers endorsing financial schemes or gambling apps without proper disclosure are liable for misleading consumers. Respectfully following the ratio of the aforesaid judgments of the Hon’ble Court (supra), we held that the Opposite Party, by using her social media influence to promote a deceptive gambling platform, is guilty of unethical business practices.

In the present case, the Opposite Party, Sanya Kapoor, a popular social media influencer with over 2 million followers, knowingly engaged in promoting BetStar99, an unregulated gambling app that falsely advertised high winning probabilities. Investigations revealed that she was not merely a promoter but also a silent partner in the gambling company, receiving a share of user losses. Using her influence, she encouraged her followers, mostly young and financially inexperienced individuals, to invest large sums in the app, leading to widespread financial distress. Complaints from numerous victims, including students and salaried professionals, highlighted that the app manipulated results to ensure users lost money.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that directing the Opposite Party to refund her earnings from the fraudulent endorsements, compensate the victims, and impose exemplary damages would meet the ends of justice. Furthermore, we are inclined to direct the Opposite Party to immediately cease all such deceptive promotional activities and fully cooperate with regulatory authorities in the investigation.

Point No.2:
In the result, the complaint is partly allowed and the Opposite Party is directed –

(i) To immediately cease and desist from engaging in any further promotion of gambling apps or similar financial schemes without proper regulatory approvals.

(ii) To refund all profits and commissions earned from the fraudulent promotion of BetStar99 to the affected users under the supervision of this Commission, within 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders.

(iii) To pay compensation of Rs.15,00,000/- (Rupees Fifteen Lakhs only) to the aggrieved users for their financial losses incurred due to her misleading promotions.

(iv) To pay exemplary damages of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakhs only) for deliberately misleading consumers and promoting financial irresponsibility.

(v) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 90 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 9% per annum until full realization.
