
This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to provide justice to the deceased's family; (ii) to ensure swift investigation and prosecute the accused; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, Mr. Ajay Sharma, reported the murder of his father, Dr. Vikas Sharma, a well-known surgeon. On 5th November 2023, Dr. Sharma was murdered in his clinic by an unknown assailant. Early investigations pointed to a former patient, Mr. Rajesh Tiwari, who had an unresolved dispute with the doctor.

Despite this lead, the investigation was delayed, and the police have failed to locate the suspect.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that further steps should be taken to expedite the investigation.

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Party (Police Authorities) are directed –

(i) To locate and arrest Mr. Rajesh Tiwari.

(ii) To compensate the complainant with ₹10,00,000 for the loss of his father.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant.

Time for compliance is 30 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 8% per annum until full realization.
