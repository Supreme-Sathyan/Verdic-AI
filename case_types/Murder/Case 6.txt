This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to expedite the murder investigation; (ii) to provide compensation to the family of the deceased; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, Mr. Rajeev Kumar, lost his younger brother, Mr. Harish Kumar, who was found dead in his apartment on 30th August 2023. Police investigations suggest that the murder was linked to a corporate rivalry and that Mr. Harish had received multiple threats from his former colleague, Mr. Sunil Soni, who was in competition for the same position at a tech firm.

Despite evidence of foul play, the investigation has been stalled due to a lack of cooperation from corporate partners.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that immediate action should be taken to ensure the investigation progresses and the complainant is compensated.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Party (Mr. Sunil Soni and Corporate Partners) are directed –

(i) To cooperate with the police in the investigation.

(ii) To pay ₹7,00,000 as compensation to the complainant.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant.

Time for compliance is 45 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 12% per annum until full realization.
