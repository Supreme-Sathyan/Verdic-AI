This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the loss of land due to fraudulent allocation; (ii) to cease the illegal land allocation process; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, a farmer, applied for land under a government scheme designed to assist landless individuals. After paying the required fees, the complainant learned that the land allocated to them was already under illegal possession by a private developer, who had bribed the government officers involved in the scheme. The official documents provided to the complainant were falsified to cover up the corruption.

The complainant has lost valuable resources and opportunities due to this corrupt land allocation process.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Parties' corrupt actions must be penalized, and the complainant should be compensated for the loss of land and opportunity.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Parties (Mr. Rajendra Mehta, Mr. Sunil Gupta, and Mr. Ajay Sharma) are directed –

(i) To compensate ₹25 lakh to the complainant for the loss of land under the fraudulent allocation process.

(ii) To cease the illegal land allocation activities and ensure that land is allocated based on fair and transparent procedures.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 12% per annum until full realization.
