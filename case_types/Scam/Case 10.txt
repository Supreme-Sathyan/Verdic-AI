This complaint is filed by the complainant U/Sec. 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to immediately cease and desist from operating a deceptive Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) scheme under the guise of an "advertisement-based earnings program"; (ii) to refund all money deposited by users who were misled into believing they could earn income by simply watching advertisements; (iii) to compensate the aggrieved users for their financial losses amounting to Rs.18,90,000/- (Rupees Eighteen Lakhs Ninety Thousand only); (iv) to award exemplary damages of Rs.4,25,000/- (Rupees Four Lakhs Twenty-Five Thousand only) for deliberately defrauding the public with misleading claims; (v) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in Example v. Pyramid Schemes Ltd. in Civil Appeal No. 2456 of 2024 CPJ 47 (SC) confirmed the orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, holding that business models disguising MLM frauds as legitimate earning opportunities constitute financial misconduct and consumer deception. Respectfully following the ratio of the aforesaid judgments of the Hon’ble Court (supra), we held that the Opposite Party, by falsely promising financial returns in exchange for passive engagement with advertisements, is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation.

In the present case, the Opposite Party, AdV3 Global Pvt. Ltd., operated a platform claiming that users could earn money by simply watching advertisements. The company assured users of guaranteed daily payouts and additional commissions for referring new members. However, evidence reveals that the primary source of income was not advertisements but recruitment fees from new users, making it a classic pyramid scheme. Early members received small payouts to establish credibility, but as the number of new recruits declined, payouts stopped entirely. Complaints surfaced as users realized they had invested substantial amounts with no possibility of withdrawal. The company abruptly shut down operations, leaving thousands of users defrauded.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that directing the Opposite Party to refund the defrauded amounts, compensate users, and impose exemplary damages would meet the ends of justice. Furthermore, we are inclined to direct the Opposite Party to immediately halt all fraudulent promotional activities and cooperate fully with regulatory authorities in the recovery of funds.

Point No.2:
In the result, the complaint is partly allowed and the Opposite Party is directed –

(i) To immediately cease and desist from operating any MLM-based earnings scheme disguised as an advertisement revenue model.

(ii) To refund all money deposited by users, which was misappropriated under false pretenses, under the supervision of this Commission, within 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders.

(iii) To pay compensation of Rs.18,90,000/- (Rupees Eighteen Lakhs Ninety Thousand only) to the affected users for their financial losses.

(iv) To pay exemplary damages of Rs.4,25,000/- (Rupees Four Lakhs Twenty-Five Thousand only) for deliberately misleading and defrauding consumers through a fraudulent business model.

(v) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 90 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 9% per annum until full realization.
