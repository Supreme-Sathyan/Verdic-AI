This complaint is filed by the complainant U/Sec. 12 of the Securities Regulation Act, 1992 praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to immediately cease and desist from engaging in manipulative stock market practices, including the dissemination of false information and baseless rumors; (ii) to disgorge all profits earned through such fraudulent manipulations and refund the ill-gotten gains to the defrauded investors; (iii) to compensate the aggrieved investors for their financial losses amounting to Rs.20,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Lakhs only); (iv) to award exemplary damages of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakhs only) for undermining market integrity and investor confidence; (v) to award costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in Example v. Market Manipulators Ltd. in Civil Appeal No. 1024 of 2024 CPJ 22 (SC) confirmed the orders of the Securities Appellate Tribunal wherein the said Tribunal directed that the Respondent, having engaged in fraudulent market practices, was liable for the misappropriation of investor funds and for causing significant market instability. Respectfully following the ratio of the aforesaid judgments of the Hon’ble Tribunal and Hon’ble Supreme Court (supra), we held that the Opposite Party, by orchestrating a deliberate campaign of misinformation and market hype, is liable for fraudulent manipulation. In the present case, Vikram “Vicky” Varadarajan, a former tea stall owner turned stock market trader in Chennai, exploited regulatory loopholes by using shell companies and benami accounts to accumulate shares of fundamentally sound companies. He then spread exaggerated and unfounded reports about these companies’ prospects through a network of associates and tipsters, manipulating media outlets and enlisting endorsements from local figures. As the stock prices surged, he gradually offloaded his holdings, reaping massive profits at the expense of small-time and unsuspecting investors. Hence, keeping in view the above said facts, we are of the considered opinion that directing the Opposite Party to disgorge his ill-gotten gains along with awarding compensation and exemplary damages would meet the ends of justice. Furthermore, we are inclined to direct the Opposite Party to immediately cease all such manipulative practices and to fully cooperate with the regulatory authorities in the recovery of funds.

Point No.2:
In the result, the complaint is partly allowed and the Opposite Party is directed –

(i) To immediately cease and desist from engaging in any further market manipulation, including the spread of false or misleading information regarding listed companies.

(ii) To disgorge all profits derived from the fraudulent manipulation of stock prices and refund such amounts to the aggrieved investors under the supervision of this Commission, within 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders.

(iii) To pay compensation of Rs.20,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Lakhs only) to the aggrieved investors for the financial losses incurred due to his actions.

(iv) To pay exemplary damages of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakhs only) for the deliberate undermining of market integrity and investor confidence.

(v) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 90 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 9% per annum until full realization.
