This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the loss of a loved one; (ii) to assist in further investigation into the circumstances leading to the murder; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, Mrs. Neha Kapoor, reported the brutal murder of her husband, Mr. Rajesh Kapoor, a prominent business tycoon in Mumbai. On 18th March 2023, Mr. Kapoor was found stabbed multiple times in his office, and the police investigation revealed that the crime was orchestrated by his business partner, Mr. Vikram Singh, who had financial motivations.

Mr. Singh was arrested but later released on bail due to lack of evidence, although he remained a prime suspect.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that further investigation and proper legal proceedings should be pursued to ensure justice for the complainant and the victim.

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Party (Mr. Vikram Singh) is directed –

(i) To pay ₹10,00,000 as compensation to the complainant.

(ii) To cooperate with the police investigation into the murder.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant.

Time for compliance is 45 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 9% per annum until full realization.
