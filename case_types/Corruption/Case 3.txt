This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the misallocation of public funds due to corruption; (ii) to cease all fraudulent practices and penalize those responsible for the embezzlement; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, a resident of the region where a government-funded low-cost housing project was launched, discovered widespread corruption in the execution of the project. The project, which was meant to provide affordable housing to underprivileged families, was manipulated by the Opposite Parties, who inflated costs, used substandard materials, and misappropriated funds intended for the construction. As a result, the housing units built were unsafe, delayed, and did not meet the required standards.

The complainant learned that a senior politician, a businessman, and a government officer were involved in the fraudulent scheme, accepting bribes to favor a construction firm with subpar capabilities. This resulted in the embezzlement of millions of rupees, depriving the community of the essential homes they were promised.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Parties' corrupt practices should be penalized, and the complainant should be compensated for the financial loss caused by the misallocation of public funds.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed and the Opposite Parties (Shri Ramesh Kumar, Mr. Suresh Gupta, and Mr. Vishal Mehra) are directed –

(i) To refund the ₹15 crore wrongly diverted from the public funds allocated for the housing project.

(ii) To cease all fraudulent practices, including the bribery, and pay a penalty for their role in the corrupt scheme.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

(iv) To ensure that proper construction standards are followed in any future housing schemes, with oversight from an independent agency.

Time for compliance is 60 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 12% per annum until full realization.
