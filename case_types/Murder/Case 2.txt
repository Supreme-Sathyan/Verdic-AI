This complaint is filed by the complainant under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to take immediate action to apprehend the murderer; (ii) to provide support and compensation to the grieving family; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant, Mr. Ravi Kapoor, reported the tragic death of his wife, Ms. Priya Kapoor, a famous singer, found dead in her recording studio on 22nd January 2024. It is believed that her murder was motivated by jealousy from a rival singer, Ms. Anjali Mehta.

The investigation has not progressed due to lack of clear evidence, and the suspect remains free.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the case should be expedited, and the complainant deserves justice.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed, and the Opposite Party (Ms. Anjali Mehta) is directed –

(i) To cooperate fully with the police investigation.

(ii) To pay ₹7,50,000 as compensation to the complainant.

(iii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant.

Time for compliance is 45 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 9% per annum until full realization.
