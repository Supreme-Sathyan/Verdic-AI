This complaint is filed by the complainant U/Sec. 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, praying this Commission to direct the Opposite Party (i) to compensate the complainant for the injuries sustained due to the hit-and-run incident caused by the Opposite Party; (ii) to pay for medical expenses incurred due to the accident; (iii) to bear the costs of the case and pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper.

The complainant was standing outside a tea stall when the Opposite Party, driving a car under the influence of alcohol, hit the complainant, causing him to fall and suffer injuries. The Opposite Party did not stop to check on the victim but fled the scene. Despite an investigation, the Opposite Party was not immediately apprehended, causing the complainant physical and emotional distress.

Keeping in view the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Party’s reckless behavior while intoxicated caused harm to the complainant and should be compensated.

Point No.2:

In the result, the complaint is partly allowed and the Opposite Party is directed –

(i) To pay compensation of Rs. 25,000 to the complainant for medical expenses and pain and suffering.

(ii) To bear the costs of litigation incurred by the complainant in instituting this proceeding.

Time for compliance is 30 days from the date of receipt of these orders, failing which the said amounts shall attract interest at the rate of 6% per annum until full realization.
